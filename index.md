I've always tried to find a nice way to show off who I am and the work that I do. I've experimented with everything from Hugo, to a Wordpress blog, all the way back to Hugo and now finally xlog.

# About me
Currently, I work as a software engineer supporting a consent and preference service at Commonwealth Bank (however, all views on this site are my own). I'm a big Python fan and try to use it as much as I can. I'm also expanding my repertoire by making my way through the AWS certifications. I'm currently working towards my AWS Developer Associate.

Previously, I worked a lot with Workday Extend developing plugins that supported the onboarding and remuneration process for employees. But now, I've been working at lot with .NET to create micro-services on AWS.

I got into engineering and technology through Lego which then snowballed into a couple of small ventures from the end of highschool well through to the end of my university degree. Like most *technologists*, I experiment with a home server and obsess over home automation.
