I have wanted to make mead for a very long time but only found the courage to attempt it recently. I found a simple recipe online [here](https://meadmaking.wiki/en/recipes/beginner/0002) and it seemed easy enough to follow that I went to a [brewing store](https://www.thehopandgrain.com.au/) in Sydney and picked up everything I needed (I also got a lot of great advice which I appreciated!).

Doing the math, my first bottles would be about $13 each but the following time it would only be $3 each (a steal!). Not that I am doing this because I want to save money...

Getting everything set up was pretty straightforward and I found StellarSan was so much better than my previous method of sterilization (which involved intense washing and then baking my bottles in the oven at 160C). I was happy that when I did my first barometer reading that both carboys were on target with what the recipe said it should be.

I'll update this page with changes as they happen! I'm excited to see fermentation finally start in a couple days.

Here are some photos:
